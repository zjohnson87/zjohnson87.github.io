      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Organically DevOps: Building Quality and Security into the Software Supply Chain at Liberty Mutual</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/publications/alldaydevops/</link>

      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <guid>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</guid>
      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/blog/force-ssl/</link>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>

      <title>Pipelined MIPS CPU in VHDL</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/mips-cpu/</link>

      <guid>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/mips-cpu/</guid>
      <description>A 5-stage pipeline CPU implementation of MIPS instruction set architecture, including hazard detection, forwarding, flushing, and stalling, all implemented in hardware. Tested using MIPS assembly programs that I wrote, including a MIPS assembly implementation of a Fibonacci number generator. Implemented as a course project with the help of one partner over the course of a half semester.</description>

      <title>Search Results</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/search/</link>

      <guid>https://zjohnson87.github.io/search/</guid>
      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>

      <title>Stitch/Width Cut Image Processor</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/image-processor/</link>

      <guid>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/image-processor/</guid>
      <description>An image processing application created for COM S 311 (Analysis and Design of Algorithms). It can make width cuts to change the width of images while causing minimal distortion, and stitch cuts to combine two images together with minimal noticeability. Cuts are made based on calculated pixel importances. Pixels with high importance are less likely to be removed by the algorithm. The assignment was done as an academic demonstration of my ability to implement iterative dynamic programming algorithms.</description>

      <title>Web Crawler and Search Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/web-crawler/</link>

      <guid>https://zjohnson87.github.io/projects/creations/web-crawler/</guid>
      <description>A web crawler application created for COM S 311 (Analysis and Design of Algorithms). It uses breadth first search to generate a graph of web pages, starting from a seed URL and creating edges to all pages linked from that page (pages downloaded using jsoup). The graph generating method also has parameters &amp;quot;maxPages&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maxDepth&amp;quot; to constrain the size of the graph. An inverted index containing the URLs, their content, and their indegrees is then created using the web graph.</description>
